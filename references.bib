    abstract = { This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of £90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market. }

    abstract = { This paper examines the response of the Airbnb ‘market’ to the shock of COVID-19, exploring the spatio-temporal variations in Airbnb listings, revenues, and hosting patterns in Greater London over the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods. At an aggregate level, Airbnb listings and revenues were found to have declined during the pandemic with disruptions differentiated according to the professional or amateur status of hosts. We then disaggregate these global trends to neighbourhood level. We explore the relative importance of socio-demographic, accessibility and neighbourhood amenities to Airbnb revenue levels across the Capital over the course of the pandemic. In doing so, we expose patterns in the Airbnb market as a result of the COVID-19 shock, revealing a geography of spatial clustering in Airbnb revenue levels over time and variations and volatility based neighbourhood deprivation. While COVID-19 certainly delivered a disruptive effect on Airbnb in Greater London, the pandemic did not de-stabilise existing geographies of Airbnb, especially in Inner London, where Airbnb remains spatially entrenched and challenges around housing affordability and neighbourhood gentrification are acute. }

We study the effects of regulation of these platforms on the housing market using a quasi-experimental research design. 18 out of 88 cities in Los Angeles County have severely restricted short-term rentals by adopting Home Sharing Ordinances. We apply a panel regression-discontinuity design around the cities’ borders. Ordinances reduced listings by 50% and housing prices by 2%. Additional difference-in-differences estimates show that ordinances reduced rents also by 2%. These estimates imply large effects of Airbnb on property values in areas attractive to tourists (e.g. an increase in house prices of 15% within 2.5km of Hollywood’s Walk of Fame).}

abstract = {Airbnb, an online marketplace for accommodations, has experienced a staggering growth accompanied by intense debates and scattered regulations around the world. Current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinions rather than empirical evidences. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting the first large-scale measurement study on Airbnb, using a crawled data set containing 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews. We measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate and the sharing economy. Among others, we find that Airbnb has reached a global yet heterogeneous coverage. The majority of its listings across many countries are entire homes, suggesting that Airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplace rather than a spare-room sharing platform. Analysis on star-ratings reveals that there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward using positive words in reviews. The extent of such bias is greater than Yelp reviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. We investigate a key issue - commercial hosts who own multiple listings on Airbnb - repeatedly discussed in the current debate. We find that their existence is prevalent, they are early movers towards joining Airbnb, and their listings are disproportionately entire homes and located in the US. Our work advances the current understanding of how Airbnb is being used and may serve as an independent and empirical reference to inform the debate.},

This study investigates (1) the effect of customer evaluation on property performance through online traveler reviews, (2) the difference of property performance between host types, and (3) how the effect of customer evaluation on property performance varies by host types. A large-scale, longitudinal dataset of the entire State of California is used for econometric analyses. A property managed by a multi-listing host makes 27.8% more revenue per available night (RevPAN) than a property managed by a single-listing host in a month. In contrast, a property managed by a full-time host makes 23.8% less RevPAN than its counterpart managed by a part-time host. While customer evaluation positively affects listing performance, its effect is divergent between professional hosts, weaker for a multi-listing host but magnified for a full-time host.}

ABSTRACT = {Riyadh has recently witnessed rapid growth in the use of short-term rentals. Their impact on the city’s housing market and long-term rentals has been critical. The emergence of recreational festivals such as the Riyadh and Diriyah Seasons, with their accompanying events, as well as the widespread use of daily rental platforms such as Airbnb, have created a new market for short-term rentals that has changed the city’s rental landscape. This study compared data on the number of units geared toward daily rent and their average daily rates (ADRs), obtained from the Airbnb platform, with data on long-term rental units and their revenue, extracted from the Ejar platform. The data cover the five sectors of Riyadh city. Sample neighborhoods were selected from each sector. The results show that after a period of stagnation due to the precautionary measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic, the short-term rental market saw a significant recovery once these measures were lifted. The emergence of the short-term rental market has negatively affected the long-term rental market by drying up its stock and raising rent prices, thus leading to tourism-induced displacement of low-income residents and further exacerbating the housing problem in the city. Therefore, there is an urgent need to regulate this new rental market to maintain a balance between short- and long-term markets in Riyadh.},
